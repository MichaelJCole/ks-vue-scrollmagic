# Ks Vue Scrollmagic

[![ks-vue-scrollmagic](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ks-vue-scrollmagic.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ks-vue-scrollmagic) [![vue2](https://img.shields.io/badge/vue-2.x-brightgreen.svg)](https://vuejs.org/)

>
Easily use ScrollMagic with vue.js (and nuxt.js...), using the directive v-scrollmagic. Work in progress... not yet production ready as some breanking changes can still be made ;)

Try it in this [ fiddle ](https://jsfiddle.net/romainPouchol/bstj6p41/5/).

## Remaining tasks

- [ ] Add installation and utilisation infos to readme.md
- [ ] Add Iscroll option
- [ ] Maybe create a directive to automatically destroy scrollmagic's controller when element is unbinded

## Contribution

I'm just a lowly frontend developer trying to master ES6, so suggestions are more than welcome, not only for feature requests but also for coding style improvements.
